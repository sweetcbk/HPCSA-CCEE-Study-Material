** The abs() function :
	returns the absolute value of a number
	a= -20.22
	print a
	-20.22
	print abs(a)
	20.22




**
	a=abc
	print a
	type(a)
	dir(a)
	len(dir(a))
	print a.__class__

Combined Availability - Two node cluster

	> Server 1
		> No specila high-availabilty feature except for RAID-1 volumes
		> Regular Backup and 98% uptime
	> Server 2
		> Same as server 1
	> Server 2 is used only 2% of the time when Server 1 is down.
	> Combined availabilty = 98% + (98% of 2)
			       = 98 + 1.96 = 99.96%




** Relaibilty :

	> Represents the probability of a component or system not encountering any failures over a time span.
	> Reliabilty is a measure of "not breaking down,once it is put in use"


** Resiliency
	> Property of a component that allows it to continue with full or partial functionality after one or more faults.
	> Able to detect and quickly compensate for faults.
	> Done by utilizing alternate resources of correcting the error.
	> Example ECC (Memory)
	> Error Correction Code
	> If errors are detected,the bad area is taken out of service,and memory addresses are moved to another area that is properly functioning.

** Serviceability
	> Probabilty of a service being completed within a given time window.
	> If a system has a serviceabilty of 0.98 for 3 hours,then there is a 98%.
	  probabilty that the service will be completed within 3 hours.

** Fault Tolerant System
	> Systems that have redundant hardware components and can operate in the presence of individual component failures.

** High Availabilty Clusters
	> Clusters consisting of two or more nodes with a number of external interconnections such as shared disks and private heartbeat network.
	> Managed by special software with a goal of providing uninterrupted service despite node failures.


** Private Heartbeat Network
	> Private network which is shared only by the cluster nodes, and is not accessible from outside the cluster.
	> Used by cluster nodes in order to monitor each node's status and communicate with each other.

** High-Performance Clusters
	> Also called parallel computing clusters.
	> Each cluster has a group of computer, tied together to work at the same time on a problem, not as backups to each other.

** DR(Disaster recovery)
	> A DR solution requires a remote, mirrored site where site where buisness and mission-critical applications can be started within a reasonable period of time 	  after the destruction of the primary site.

** High Availabilty Metrics - MTBF
	> Averable time interval(usually in hours) between two consecutive failures of a certain component or system.

** High Availabilty Metrics - MTTR
	> Average lenght of time required to complete a repair action.
		Availabilty = MTBF / (MTBF + MTTR)
		or
		Availabilty = UPTIME / (UPTIME + DOWNTIME)
** Different Levels of Availabilty

	> Level 1 - Depend on built-in Hardware Reliabilty
        	> Also called Base availability
	        > Achieved with a single system and basic system management practices in place.

	> Level 2 - Data Protection
		> RAID
		> RAID Controller

	> Level 2 - FT	 

		> Expensive
		> SPOF - Single Point Failure
		> OS Crash
